Should have looked through the Tkinter worksheets on Moodle as well as the
GitHub introduction. PyCharm installation and building up familiarity with it &
Git.

### Aston

### George

* Looked over project specifications, created notes outlining outcomes and
  approaches
* Gathered info relating to Git / PyCharm and prepared [Git] workflow activity
  for meeting.
* Looked at ideas for representation of algorithms - visualising path finding
  using the Robot and possible methods to present this.

# Discussion for next week

## Tasks for next session

### All members

While we're not deep into the project it's a good opertunity to try and sharpen
tooling, workflow and familiarity with what's going to be involved.

#### Git 

* Read through the Intro to GitHub sheet on Moodle
* Go through the following videos
  [video one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc&index=14),
  [video two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYyTZwMyAg&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc&index=15).
* Complete Activity below

#### Git Activity

This was to go over in the meeting but is worth looking at. The idea is to get a
feel of the approach that will be used when collaborating on the project in
terms of implementing features on your machines locally and committing them to
the main remote repo. 

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repo located at `url` to your GitHub 
2. Clone the repo (from your GitHub) locally
3. [Create a branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-branch)
   with an appropriate name
4. Checkout the branch and implement the required features
5. Commit changes to repo locally with appropriate commit message.
6. [Push the changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-branch)
   to **your** remote
7. Create a pull request to the **develop** branch of the master repo
8. I'll get a notification of the changes and the code can be reviewed, there is
   a provided thread for any needed discussion around the commit.

**re point 5:** 

* Use present tense and write in the imperative: “Fix bug”, not “fixed bug” or
  “fixes bug”.
* Start with a capitalized, short (72 characters or less) summary, followed by a
  blank line.
* If necessary, add one or more paragraphs with details, wrapped at 72
  characters.
* Separate paragraphs by blank lines.

> "*This is way too long winded for what needs to be done*"

I wrote a bit out in response to this
[but there's](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/command-line/basics/why-use-version-control)
plenty of response to this
[online](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=why+use+git&oq=why+use+git&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5.1446j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8)
if you're curious or feeling that it's a bit mental.

#### PyCharm

* Register for the education version and install
* Have a mess about with inspecting code within it (note that when you first
  load a project it will run slowly as it analyses the project structure).
* Test out Git integration and stuff, code refactoring etc, try and report /
  note down anything handy you find for others to have a look at too (as we're
  all kinda new to it)

#### Markdown

Very basic markup language used on line a lot, worth being familiar with as
GitHub uses it for README files and such (it can also use Org mode - though I'm
not sure that anyone else is interested in that).

### George

* Look through the designs made in the last session, consider graphical
  implementations for the simulation
* Research some of the algorithms that might be implemented for the simulation
* Research use of testing in code and weather they can be generated.
